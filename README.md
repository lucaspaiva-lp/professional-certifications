# Professional Certifications

This repository centralizes my public professional certifications in a structured and verifiable way.
Only relevant certifications related to software development, backend engineering, and core technical skills are included.
The purpose is documentation and traceability; certifications do not replace hands-on experience or real-world projects.
For practical experience and active projects, please refer to my main GitHub profile: https://github.com/lucaspaiva-lp
