# Certification Criteria

This repository contains curated professional certifications related to software development and backend engineering.

Included items must be directly relevant to programming, software architecture, databases, testing, or supporting technical domains.

Short courses, workshops, and online marathons are included when they provide practical or conceptual value.

Certifications unrelated to software engineering (e.g. design, marketing, or soft skills) are intentionally excluded to maintain focus.

All certifications listed here complement, but do not replace, hands-on experience demonstrated in real-world projects.
